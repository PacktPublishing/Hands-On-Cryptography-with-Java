This is the code repository for [Hands-On Cryptography with Java [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-cryptography-java-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Security is paramount for any application. Cryptography occurs all across software fields: it protects all HTTPS traffic between browsers, encrypts phone storage against prying eyes, and can even hide files inside other files through a technique called steganography. This course is for developers looking to design a system that uses cryptography, rather than designing new algorithms. Most developers simply need to put the right pieces together to make their own system work.
In this course, you will break down the concepts behind cryptography into simple lessons, covering terminology, algorithms, standards, and encryption/decryption techniques. We will also walk through how cryptographic systems are hacked to bypass (rather than break) their cryptographic capabilities.

<UL>
<LI>The course answers questions such as:
<LI>What is cryptography used for?
<LI>What are keys and where do they go?
<LI>Why do networked systems sometimes give certificate validation errors?
<LI>If I need to encrypt something, how should I do that?
</LI></UL></DIV>
By the end of this course, you will recognize cryptographic problems and understand the right knowledge to apply a verifiable solution.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
This video course is for developers whose applications require encryption, or integration with an external cryptographic system. The course requires knowledge of Java programming but does not require a degree in mathematics or advanced computer science.
Java developers building standard applications that require encryption, developers looking to understand flaws in cryptographic systems, and developers who do not want flaws in their cryptographic systems will benefit from this course.
### Technical Requirements
This course has the following requirements:<br/>
OS: Windows 7 or Windows 10<br/>
Browser: Google Chrome, Latest Version<br/>
Code Editor: Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans<br/>
Others: Java 8 or higher<br/>
Processor: Intel Core i7 or equivalent<br/>
